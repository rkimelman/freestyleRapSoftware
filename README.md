# freestyleRapSoftware

- I obtained my rap lyrics dataset from MCFlow (Condit-Schultz, 2016).
- This version of Freestyle Rap Software was made in JupyterLab version 3.3.0, Python version 3.8.3, and R version 4.1.2.
- Refer to pgs 1-2 of the user guide of ipywidgets if you are using JupyterLab and having trouble using ipywidgets: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/7.6.3/pdf/
